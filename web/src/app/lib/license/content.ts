    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

    1. Definitions.

        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
        and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

        "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
        the copyright owner that is granting the License.

        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
        "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
        otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
        outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
        exercising permissions granted by this License.

        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation
        source, and configuration files.

        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                              Preamble

    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
    software and other kinds of works.

    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
    to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
    software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
    any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
    your programs, too.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
    freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.

    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.

    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    0. Definitions.

    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.

    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.

    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

    1. Source Code.

    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.

    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.

    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.

    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.

    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.

    2. Basic Permissions.

    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.

    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.

    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.

    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
      it, and giving a relevant date.

      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
      released under this License and any conditions added under section
      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
      "keep intact all notices".

      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
      work need not make them do so.

    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
  parts of the aggregate.

    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  in one of these ways:

      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
      customarily used for software interchange.

      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
      with subsection 6b.

      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
      charge under subsection 6d.

    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.

    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  the only significant mode of use of the product.

    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  modification has been made.

    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
  been installed in ROM).

    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
  protocols for communication across the network.

    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  unpacking, reading or copying.

    7. Additional Terms.

    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.

    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
      Notices displayed by works containing it; or

      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
      those licensors and authors.

    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
  not survive such relicensing or conveying.

    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
  where to find the applicable terms.

    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
  the above requirements apply either way.

    8. Termination.

    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
  your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.

    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

    11. Patents.

    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
  this License.

    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
  propagate the contents of its contributor version.

    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
  patent against the party.

    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
  country that you have reason to believe are valid.

    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
  work and works based on it.

    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
  combination as such.

    14. Revised Versions of this License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
  by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
  to choose that version for the Program.

    Later license versions may give you additional or different
  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
  later version.

    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    16. Limitation of Liability.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
  copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type \`show
      w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type \`show c' for details.

  The hypothetical commands \`show w' and \`show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
    <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.`,

  "lgpl-3.0": `GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                      Version 3, 29 June 2007

    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
    the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

    0. Additional Definitions.

    As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
    General Public License.

    "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
    other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

    An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
    by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
    Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
    of using an interface provided by the Library.

    A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
    Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
    with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
    Version".

    The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
    Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
    for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
    based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

    The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
    object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
    and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
    Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

    1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
  without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

    2. Conveying Modified Versions.

    If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
  facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
  that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
  facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
  version:

    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
    this License applicable to that copy.

    3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

    The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
  a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
  code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
  material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
  layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
  (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

    4. Combined Works.

    You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
  taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
  portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
  engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
  the following:

    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

    d) Do one of the following:

        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
        Corresponding Source.

        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
        Version.

    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
    for conveying Corresponding Source.)

    5. Combined Libraries.

    You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
  Library side by side in a single library together with other library
  facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
  License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
  choice, if you do both of the following:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
    conveyed under the terms of this License.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
  Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
  of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
  conditions either of that published version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
  received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

    If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
  whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
  apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
  permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
    Library.`,

  "o-uda-1.0": `Open Use of Data Agreement v1.0

    This is the Open Use of Data Agreement, Version 1.0 (the "O-UDA").
    Capitalized terms are defined in Section 5. Data Provider and you agree as
    follows:

    **Comment**: _The O-UDA is intended for use by a Data Provider that owns
    (or has sufficient rights from a data owner) to distribute data for
    unrestricted uses, subject to applicable laws governing the use of datasets
    of the type distributed. The O-UDA is not intended for a use of Data that
    may include personal data, or data not owned by a data provider. To be
    precise, it is not appropriate for data sets that include any data that
    might include materials subject to privacy laws such as the GDPR or HIPAA,
    or third party materials subject to copyright laws that have not been
    licensed for unrestricted use or dedicated to the public domain._

    1. **Provision of the Data**

        1.1. You may use, modify, and distribute the Data made available to you
        by the Data Provider under this O-UDA if you follow the O-UDA's terms.

          **Comment**: _The O-UDA permits very broad use of Data, and also
          modification and redistribution of the Data, so long as the recipient
          meets the O-UDA's requirements (and there are only a few of these).
          It is styled as a "permission to use" rather than a grant of specific
          rights, because the rights that may be applicable to any given
          database
          (whether copyright, database rights, or merely access rights) may vary
          around the world._

        1.2. Data Provider will not sue you or any Downstream Recipient for any
        claim arising out of the use, modification, or distribution of the Data
        provided you meet the terms of the O-UDA.

          **Comment**: _This is a promise by the Data Provider not to sue the
          user
          so long as the user complies with O-UDA's requirements. It doesn't
          allow a Data Provider to terminate a permitted use of the Data, but it
          does allow the Data Provider to bring an action to enforce the O-UDA's
          terms._

        1.3 This O-UDA does not restrict your use, modification, or distribution
        of any portions of the Data that are in the public domain or that may be
        used, modified, or distributed under any other legal exception or
        limitation.

          **Comment**: _This provision clarifies that the O-UDA is not intended
          to
          restrict the use, modification, or distribution of any materials
          within
          the Data that are in the public domain. Such materials can be used,
          modified, or distributed without needing to meet the requirements or
          obligations of this Agreement. Similarly, the Agreement is not
          intended
          to restrict the use, modification distribution of any materials within
          the Data if any applicable legal exception or limitation (e.g., fair
          use) would otherwise permit their use, modification, or distribution._

    2. **No Restrictions on Use or Results**

        2.1. The O-UDA does not impose any restriction with respect to:

          2.1.1. the use or modification of Data; or

          2.1.2. the use, modification, or distribution of Results.

    3. **Redistribution of Data**

        3.1. You may redistribute the Data under terms of your choice, so long
        as:

          3.1.1. You include with any Data you redistribute all credit or
          attribution information that you received with the Data, and your
          terms
          require any Downstream Recipient to do the same; and

          3.1.2. Your terms include a warranty disclaimer and limitation of
          liability for Upstream Data Providers at least as broad as those
          contained in Section 4.2 and 4.3 of the O-UDA.

          **Comment**: _The only requirements for redistributing Data are to
          maintain attribution (if any) and use an agreement that contains
          Section 4’s disclaimers and limitations on liability, so that
          Downstream Recipients are bound by it for their use. These two
          restrictions apply only to the Data, but not to Results.
          Maintaining attribution is an accepted practice for sharing
          data to indicate its source or provenance. Requiring the use of
          disclaimers and liability limitations for subsequent distribution
          provides further certainty to a Data Provider._

    4. **No Warranty, Limitation of Liability**

        4.1. Data Provider does not represent or warrant that it has any rights
         whatsoever in the Data.

          **Comment**: _We have chosen a broad disclaimer of representations
          and warranties, which may not be appropriate in commercial contexts.
           These disclaimers are common in the open data context to encourage
            possessors of data to share the data without requiring them to make
            promises about the data. Because the Data Provider makes no claims
             that they have rights in the data, the Downstream Recipient must
             ensure that its use of the Data conforms to applicable laws or
             regulations. A Data Provider should not use the O-UDA for Data that
              it knows should not be distributed, or data that contains
              sensitive
              or private information._

        4.2. THE DATA IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
        CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

        4.3. NEITHER DATA PROVIDER NOR ANY UPSTREAM DATA PROVIDER SHALL HAVE ANY
         LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS),
          HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
          STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING
           IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE DATA OR RESULTS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
           POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

          **Comment**: _These disclaimers are necessary to limit Data
          Provider's
          liability. They disclaim both express and implied warranties or
          representations, and the  disclaimer applies to all Upstream Data
          Providers. These limitations of liability are common in the open data
           context to encourage possessors of data to share the data without
           requiring them to accept liability to a user for downstream uses of
           the data, but may not be appropriate in commercial contexts._

    5. **Definitions**

        5.1. "Data" means the material you receive under the O-UDA in modified
        or unmodified form, but not including Results.

          **Comment**: _The term "Data" encompasses both the initial data made
          available to "you" as well as any later modifications made to that
          data by a Data Provider or a Downstream Recipient that redistributes
          the data. This also means that Downstream Recipients remain free to
          modify the data. Data specifically excludes Results._

        5.2. "Data Provider" means the source from which you receive the Data
         and with whom you enter into the O-UDA.

        5.3. "Downstream Recipient" means any person or persons who receives
        the Data directly or indirectly from you in accordance with the O-UDA.

        5.4. "Result" means anything that you develop or improve from your use
         of Data that does not include more than a de minimis portion of the
         Data on which the use is based.  Results may include de minimis
         portions of the Data necessary to report on or explain use that has
          been conducted with the Data, such as figures in scientific papers,
          but do not include more.  Artificial intelligence models trained on
          Data (and which do not include more than a de minimis portion of Data)
           are Results.

          **Comment**: _The O-UDA defines "Result" to clarify that any AI
          model
           produced from the use of the Data (e.g., as a training set) should
           not typically be considered to be subject to the O-UDA's
           restrictions.
            The O-UDA considers that Results are not a "derivative" or a
            "modification" of the Data if they don't contain more than a de
             minimis portion of the Data. This is also intended to clarify
              that research papers and accompanying figures that may include
              only a de minimis part of the Data are not subject to any
              restriction in the O-UDA._

      5.5. "Upstream Data Providers" means the source or sources from which
      the Data Provider directly or indirectly received, under the terms of
       the O-UDA, material that is included in the Data.`,

  "eupl-1.2": `EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2
                          EUPL © the European Union 2007, 2016

    This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as
    defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of
    the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the
    extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

    The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
    defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
    copyright notice for the Work:

            Licensed under the EUPL

    or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the

      communicated by
    the
      Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as
      Executable
      Code as the case may be.

    - ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the
      Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
      Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the
      Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;
      this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country
      mentioned in Article 15.

    - ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.

    - 'The Source Code': the human-readable form of the Work which is
      the most
      convenient for people to study and modify.

    - ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and
    which
      is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

    - ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or
    communicates
      the Work under the Licence.

    - 'Contributor(s)': any natural or legal person who modifies the
      Work under
      the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative
      Work.

      any usage
    of
      the Work under the terms of the Licence.

    - 'Distribution' or 'Communication': any act of selling, giving,
      lending,
      renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
      available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to
      its
      essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
      person.

    2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

    The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright
    vested in the Original Work:

    - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
    - reproduce the Work,
    - modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
    - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or
    display
      the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case
      may be, the Work,
    - distribute the Work or copies thereof,
    - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
    - sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.

    Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether
    now
    known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

    In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
    exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
    effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

    The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights
    to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
    the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

    3. Communication of the Source Code

    The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
    Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
    provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
    along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,
    in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a
    repository
    where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
    Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

    4. Limitations on copyright

    Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
    from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights
    owners
    in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable
    limitations thereto.

    5. Obligations of the Licensee

    The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
    obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

    Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
    trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
    disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices
    and
    a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
    communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
    notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of
    modification.

    Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
    Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will
    be
    done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
    unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of
    the Licence — for example by communicating 'EUPL v. 1.2 only'. The
    Licensee
    (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or
    conditions
    on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
    Licence.

    Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
    Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed
    under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done
    under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
    'Compatible Licence' refers to the licences listed in the appendix
    attached
    to
    this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence
    conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
    Compatible Licence shall prevail.

    Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the
    Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
    or
    indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available
    for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

    Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as
    required
    for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
    reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

    6. Chain of Authorship

    The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work
    granted
    hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
    power and authority to grant the Licence.

    Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
    brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that
    he/she
    has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

    Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
    Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under
    the
    terms of this Licence.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty

    The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
    Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
    ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.

    For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an
    'as is'
    basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
    without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
    absence
    of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
    rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

    This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
    condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

    8. Disclaimer of Liability

    Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to
    natural
    persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
    material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the
    use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
    commercial
    damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
    damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product
    liability
    laws as far such laws apply to the Work.

    9. Additional agreements

    While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
    agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.
    However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and
    on
    your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any
    other
    Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
    Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
    against
    such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional
    liability.

    10. Acceptance of the Licence

    The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I
    agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this
    Licence
    or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the
    rules
    of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and
    irrevocable
    acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

    Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
    conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
    Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative
    Work
    or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

    11. Information to the public

    In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of
    electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the
    Work
    from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a
    website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by
    the
    applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
    accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

    12. Termination of the Licence

    The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon
    any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

    Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
    received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
    remain in full compliance with the Licence.

    13. Miscellaneous

    Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
    agreement between the Parties as to the Work.

    If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
    law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
    whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make
    it
    valid and enforceable.

    The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new
    versions
    of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required
    and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the
    Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version
    number.

    All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European
    Commission,
    have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version
    of
    their choice.

    14. Jurisdiction

    Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

    - any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
      between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a
      Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the
      Court
      of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the
      Treaty
      on the Functioning of the European Union,

    - any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the
      interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive
      jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts
      its primary business.

    15. Applicable Law

    Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

    - this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member
    State
      where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,

    - this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,
      residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.

    Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
    conditions
    that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
    authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
    specified in the public license below.

    The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
    those
    authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
    restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable.
    Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
    they
    choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
    before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
    expected.
    Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This
    includes other material, or material used under an exception or limitation
    to
    copyright. More considerations for licensors :
    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
    licensor
    grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified
    terms
    and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any
    reason–for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright–then
    that
    use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
    under
    copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant.
    Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including
    because
    others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
    special
    requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although
    not
    required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
    reasonable. More considerations for the public :

    3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
    authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
    whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
    necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
    right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
    modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For
    purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
    this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5. Downstream recipients.
    A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
    Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
    exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public
    License.
    B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
    or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
    Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
    construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use
    of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or
    granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
    attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
    b. Other rights.
    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
    this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
    personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
    and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
    limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but
    not otherwise.
    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
    royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
    directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
    statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor
    expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
    Section 3 License Conditions.

    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.

    a. Attribution.
    1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:
    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
     Material:
    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
    designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
    Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
    ii. a copyright notice;
    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
    practicable;
    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
     of any previous modifications; and
    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
    and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
    2. For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public
    License to Share Adapted Material.
    3. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
     manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
     Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
     conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
     the required information.
    4. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
    required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
    Section 4 Sui Generis Database Rights.

    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
    to Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database, provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
     a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
     database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights
     (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or
    a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
     Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights
     include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
    Section 5 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
     and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
     Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.
     This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability,
      fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent
      or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors,
      whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
      are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
    b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You
    on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
     for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
      exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
      this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
       has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
       damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in
        part, this limitation may not apply to You.
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
     shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
      approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    Section 6 Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
    Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
    License,
     then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
    cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
     the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this
     Public License.
    d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
     Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate
     this Public License.
    e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
    Section 7 Other Terms and Conditions.

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
    or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
     Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
     and conditions of this Public License.
    Section 8 Interpretation.

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
    be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
     of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission
     under this Public License.
    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
     unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed,
     it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
     enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
    limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply
    to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any
    jurisdiction or authority.`,

    Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms
    and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
     original works ofauthorship and other material subject to copyright and
     certain other rights specified in the public license below.

    The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
    those
    authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
    restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable.
    Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
    they
    choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
    before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
    expected.
    Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This
    includes other material, or material used under an exception or limitation
    to
    copyright. More considerations for licensors :
    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
    licensor
    grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified
    terms
    and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any
    reason–for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright–then
    that
    use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
    under
    copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant.
    Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including
    because
    others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
    special
    requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although
    not
    required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
    reasonable. More considerations for the public :

    Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License

    By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
    be bound by the terms and conditions of this
    Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
    Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be
     interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
     consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the

    that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the

    and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
    License,

    Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched
    in timed relation with a moving image.

    broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without

    Copyright and Similar Rights.
    e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
    absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
    obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
    December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
    f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
     exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
     Your use of the Licensed Material.

    or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
    i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the

    Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material
     and that the Licensor has authority to license.

    this Public License.

    from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
    l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
     from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
      March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
      succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere
      in the world.
    m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
    under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
    Section 2 Scope.

    a. License grant.
    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
     hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
     non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in
     the Licensed Material to:
    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
    authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats

    necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
    right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
    modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For
    purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
    this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5. Downstream recipients.
    A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
    Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
    exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public
    License.
    B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient
    of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the
    Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the
    conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
    C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
    or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
    Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
    construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use
    of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or
    granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
    attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
    b. Other rights.
    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
    this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
    personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
    and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
    limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but
    not otherwise.
    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
    royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
    directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
    statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor
    expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

     of any previous modifications; and
    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
    and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
    manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
    Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
    conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
    the required information.
    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
    required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
    b. ShareAlike.In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share

    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
    Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database;
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in
     a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
      in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights
      (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for
      purposes of Section 3(b); and
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
    Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
     other Copyright and Similar Rights.
    Section 5 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,

     This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability,
      fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or
       other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether
       or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
       allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

    out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the
    Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs,
    expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in
    full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    Section 6 Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
     Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
     License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
     automatically.
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:

  "odbl-1.0": `Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)

    Preamble

    The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow
    users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while maintaining this
    same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and
    therefore this document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in
    the European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the
    ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an agreement in
    contract for users of this Database to act in certain ways in return for
    accessing this Database.

    Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
    audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and
    so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents
    of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with
    another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of
    rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have
    multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what rights
    govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way
    that clarifies what rights apply.

    Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered
    by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark
    over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information
    in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other
    documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this
    License.

    ------

    The Licensor (as defined below)

    and

    You (as defined below)

    agree as follows:

    1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words
    "Collective Database" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a
    collection of independent databases in themselves that together are

    the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a
    Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database.
    Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer
    network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy
    of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.

    "Contents" - The contents of this Database, which includes the information,
    independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For
    example, the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as

    whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights
    available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.

    "Derivative Database" - Means a database based upon the Database, and
    includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any
    other alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents.
    This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole
    or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.

    "Extraction" - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a
    Substantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any

    Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.

    2.0 What this License covers
    2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:
    a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;
    b. A license of the Database Right; and
    c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.
    2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
    Database, including:
    a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The
    copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but
    does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database.
    See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but
    is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure,
    arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the
    Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the
    Field names of Contents stored in the Database;
    b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
    Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database
    Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database
    Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and
    are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable
    copyright; and
    c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to
    the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this
    access as outlined in this License.
    2.3 Rights not covered.
    a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or
    operation of the Database;
    b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
    Database; and
    c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database.
    2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the
    Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
    including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
    rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
    Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For
    example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would
    not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own
    separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the
    images.
    3.0 Rights granted
    3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants
    to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under
    Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable
    copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial
    use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in
    the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and
    formats whether now known or created in the future.
    The rights granted cover, for example:

    a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the
    Contents;
    b. Creation of Derivative Databases;
    c. Creation of Collective Databases;
    d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any
    form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a
    part of Collective Databases; and
    e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
    performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part,
    including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective Databases.
    3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:
    a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
    the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
    scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
    collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
    this License;
    b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
    right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
    scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect
    such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
    License; and,
    c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
    member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes,
    via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
    License.
    3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
    distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this
    Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using
    alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other
    rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.
    4.0 Conditions of Use
    4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your
    complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
    conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in
    material breach of its terms.
    4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database,
    or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:
    a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted
    under Section 4.4;
    b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted
    under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the
    Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or
    Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and
    c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that
    refer to this License.
    d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file
    due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such
    as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.
    4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work
    does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a
    Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work
    reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses,
    interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that
    Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database
    as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this
    License.
    a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:
    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here under
    the Open Database License (ODbL).

    DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
    hyperlink to the URI of the Database. "Open Database License" should contain
    a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not
    possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI's with the
    above notice.

    4.4 Share alike.
    a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the
    terms of:
    i. This License;
    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or
    iii. A compatible license.
    If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses mentioned
    in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.

    b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or
    a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative
    Database and must comply with Section 4.4.
    c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is
    Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work
    created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.
    d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must
    not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are
    incompatible with the rights granted under this License.
    e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine
    compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the authorised
    proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible license grants You
    permission to use the compatible license.
    4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in
    the following:
    a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective
    Databases under this License if You incorporate this Database or a
    Derivative Database in the collection, but this License still applies to
    this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of the Collective Database;
    b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a
    Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative
    Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and
    c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to
    the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section
    4.4.
    4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative
    Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also offer
    to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy in a
    machine readable form of:
    a. The entire Derivative Database; or
    b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or the
    method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm),
    including any additional Contents, that make up all the differences between
    the Database and the Derivative Database.
    The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be
    available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical
    distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.

    4.7 Technological measures and additional terms
    a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7
    b.) any terms or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative
    Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or
    restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have
    the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise
    those rights.
    b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological measures on
    the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of
    the Contents (a "Restricted Database") in contravention of Section 4.74 a.
    only if You also make a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database
    available to the recipient of the Restricted Database:
    i. That is available without additional fee;
    ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms
    of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or
    intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights (an
    "Unrestricted Database"); and
    iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the recipient as
    a practical matter as the Restricted Database.
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative
    Database in an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a
    similar access control scheme provided that You do not alter or restrict the
    terms of this License or any rights granted under it or have the effect or
    intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.
    4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You
    communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or
    any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to
    the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as
    this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
    parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over
    a Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a
    Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may
    not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or
    affirmed under this License.
    5.0 Moral rights
    5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to
    be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that
    would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other
    derogatory treatment:
    a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all
    moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent
    possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;
    b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant
    jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights
    over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest
    extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;
    and
    c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral
    rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights
    over certain aspects of the Database.
    Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
    rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
    jurisdictions.

    6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected
    6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
    independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
    Database, including without limitation:
    a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from
    non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of
    illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or
    Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial
    procedure.
    b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or
    exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.
    6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and
    Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or
    qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative
    Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The
    repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts
    of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
    Substantial part of the Contents.
    7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer
    7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any
    warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
    custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims
    any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement,
    accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a
    particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not
    allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply
    to You.
    8.0 Limitation of liability
    8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
    Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss
    or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this
    License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault
    on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes,
    but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or
    exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and
    lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.
    8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
    direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the
    part of the Licensor.
    9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License
    9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
    automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
    notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
    Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
    Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is
    in full compliance with this License or a license granted under Section 4.8
    of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination
    of this License.
    9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will
    not terminate Your rights under it.
    9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for
    the duration of applicable rights in the Database.
    9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and
    conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License will be
    reinstated:
    a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day
    after cessation of breach;
    b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise
    reasonably notified by the Licensor; or
    c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this
    is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from
    the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt
    of the notice.
    Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to be a
    recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.

    9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making
    available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms
    or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License
    (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
    terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
    10.0 General
    10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
    unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each remaining
    provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent
    permitted by law.
    10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect
    to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier
    understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database.
    10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be
    entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach
    by the Licensor.
    10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the
    laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
    be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes
    additional rights not granted under this License, these additional rights
    are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this License.

  "odc-by-1.0": `Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By)
    Preamble

    The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement intended to
    allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database subject only to
    the attribution requirements set out in Section 4.

    Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
    audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and
    so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not the
    contents of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use
    this license together with another license for the contents.

    Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered
    by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark
    over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information
    in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other
    documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this
    License.

    ------

    The Licensor (as defined below)

    and

    You (as defined below)

    agree as follows:

    2.0 What this License covers
    2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:
    a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;
    b. A license of the Database Right; and
    c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.
    2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the
    Database, including:
    a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The
    copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but
    does not cover the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database.
    See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but
    is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the structure,
    arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also include the
    Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the
    Field names of Contents stored in the Database;
    b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
    Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database
    Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database
    Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and
    are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable
    copyright; and
    c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to
    the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this
    access as outlined in this License.
    2.3 Rights not covered.
    a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or
    operation of the Database;
    b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the
    Database; and
    c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database.
    2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the
    Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,
    including copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality
    rights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database
    Rights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database. For
    example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would
    not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own
    separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the
    images.
    3.0 Rights granted
    3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants
    to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under
    Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable
    copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial
    use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in
    the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and
    formats whether now known or created in the future.
    The rights granted cover, for example:

    a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the
    Contents;
    b. Creation of Derivative Databases;
    c. Creation of Collective Databases;
    d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any
    form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a
    part of Collective Databases; and
    e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
    performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part,
    including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective Databases.
    3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:
    a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
    the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
    scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
    collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
    this License;
    b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
    right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
    scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect
    such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
    License; and,
    c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
    member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes,
    via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
    License.
    3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
    distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this
    Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using
    alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other
    rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.
    4.0 Conditions of Use
    4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your
    complying with the following conditions of use. These are important
    conditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in
    material breach of its terms.
    4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database,
    or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:
    a. Do so only under the terms of this License;
    b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or
    Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;
    c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that
    refer to this License; and
    d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file
    due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such
    as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.
    4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work
    does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a
    Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work
    reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses,
    interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that
    Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database
    as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this
    License.
    a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:
    Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available under the
    ODC Attribution License.

    DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
    hyperlink to the location of the Database. "ODC Attribution License" should
    contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks
    are not possible, You should include the plain text of the required URI's
    with the above notice.

    4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You
    communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or
    any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to
    the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as
    this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
    parties with this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over
    a Derivative Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a
    Derivative Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may
    not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or
    affirmed under this License.
    5.0 Moral rights
    5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to
    be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that
    would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other
    derogatory treatment:
    a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all
    moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent
    possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;
    b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant
    jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights
    over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest
    extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;
    and
    c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral
    rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights
    over certain aspects of the Database.
    Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
    rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
    jurisdictions.

    6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected
    6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
    independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
    Database, including without limitation:
    a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from
    non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of
    illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or
    Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial
    procedure.
    b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or
    exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.
    6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and
    Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or
    qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative
    Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The
    repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts
    of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
    Substantial part of the Contents.
    7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer
    7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any
    warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
    custom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims
    any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement,
    accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a
    particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not
    allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply
    to You.
    8.0 Limitation of liability
    8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
    Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss
    or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this
    License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault
    on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes,
    but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or
    exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and
    lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.
    8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
    direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the
    part of the Licensor.
    9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License
    9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
    automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
    notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
    Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
    Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is
    in full compliance with this License or a license granted under Section 4.8
    of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination
    of this License.
    9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will
    not terminate Your rights under it.
    9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for
    the duration of applicable rights in the Database.
    9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and
    conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License will be
    reinstated:
    a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day
    after cessation of breach;
    b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise
    reasonably notified by the Licensor; or
    c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this
    is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from
    the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt
    of the notice.
    9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making
    available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms
    or stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License
    (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
    terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
    10.0 General
    10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
    unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each remaining
    provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent
    permitted by law.
    10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect
    to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier
    understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Database.
    10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be
    entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach
    by the Licensor.
    10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the
    laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
    be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes
    additional rights not granted under this License, these additional rights
    are granted in this License in order to meet the terms of this License.

    Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
    conditions
    that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
    authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
    specified in the public license below.

    The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
    those
    authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
    restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable.
    Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
    they
    choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
    before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
    expected.
    Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This
    includes other material, or material used under an exception or limitation
    to
    copyright. More considerations for licensors :
    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
    licensor
    grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified
    terms
    and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any
    reason–for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright–then
    that
    use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
    under
    copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant.
    Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including
    because
    others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
    special
    requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although
    not
    required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
    reasonable. More considerations for the public :

    Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC BY 4.0)

    By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
    be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution
    4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this
    Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the
    Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and
    conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of
    benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available
    under these terms and conditions.

    Section 1 Definitions.

    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
    that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
    Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
    otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
    Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License,
    where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound
    recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material
    is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
    Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with
    the terms and conditions of this Public License.
    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
    closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
    broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard
    to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public
    License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and
    Similar Rights.
    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
    absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
    obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
    December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
    exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your
    use of the Licensed Material.
    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
    material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
    conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
    Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
    Licensor has authority to license.
    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under
    this Public License.
    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process
    that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
    public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
    communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public
    including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a
    place and at a time individually chosen by them.
    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
    from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
    March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
    succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
    world.
    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
    this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
    Section 2 Scope.

    a. License grant.
    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
    hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
    non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
    Licensed Material to:
    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
    and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and
    You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
    3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
    authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
    whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
    necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
    right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
    modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For
    purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
    this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5. Downstream recipients.
    A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
    Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
    exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public
    License.
    B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
    or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
    Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
    construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use
    of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or
    granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
    attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
    b. Other rights.
    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
    this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
    personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
    and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
    limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but
    not otherwise.
    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
    royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
    directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
    statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor
    expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
    Section 3 License Conditions.

    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.

    a. Attribution.
    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
    must:
    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
    Material:
    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
    designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
    Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
    ii. a copyright notice;
    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
    practicable;
    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
    of any previous modifications; and
    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
    include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
    manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
    Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
    conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the
    required information.
    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
    required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You
    apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying
    with this Public License.
    Section 4 Sui Generis Database Rights.

    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
    Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database;
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
    is Adapted Material; and
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
    Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
    other Copyright and Similar Rights.

    Section 5 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
    and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
    Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
    includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
    known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
    b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
    for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
    exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
    Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has
    been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.
    Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
    limitation may not apply to You.
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    Section 6 Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
    Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
    License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
    within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
    the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.
    d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
    Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
    Public License.
    e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
    Section 7 Other Terms and Conditions.

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
    and conditions of this Public License.
    Section 8 Interpretation.

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
    be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
    of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission
    under this Public License.
    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
    shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
    enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
    to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
    limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
    the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
    or authority.`,

    Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
    they
    choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
    before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
    expected.
    Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This
    includes other material, or material used under an exception or limitation
    to
    copyright. More considerations for licensors :

    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
    licensor
    grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified
    terms
    and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any
    reason–for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright–then
    that
    use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
    under
    copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant.
    Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including
    because
    others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
    special
    requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although
    not
    required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
    reasonable. More considerations for the public :

    By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
    be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
    Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public
    License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
    contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your

    that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
    Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
    otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
    Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License,
    where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound
    recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material
    is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

    closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
    broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard
    to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public
    License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and
    Similar Rights.
    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
    absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
    obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on

    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
    exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your
    use of the Licensed Material.

    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and

    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under
    this Public License.
    i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
    commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
    License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to
    Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
    NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
    connection with the exchange.
    j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process
    that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
    public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
    communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public
    including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a
    place and at a time individually chosen by them.
    k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
    from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11

    succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
    world.
    l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
    this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
    Section 2 Scope.

    a. License grant.
    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
    hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
    non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
    Licensed Material to:
    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
    NonCommercial purposes only; and
    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
    only.
    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
    and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and
    You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
    3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
    authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
    whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
    necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
    right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
    modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For
    purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
    this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5. Downstream recipients.
    A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
    Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
    exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public
    License.
    B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
    or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
    Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
    construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use
    of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or
    granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
    attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
    b. Other rights.
    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
    this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
    personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
    and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
    limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but
    not otherwise.
    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
    royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly
    or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
    compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
    reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed
    Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.
    Section 3 License Conditions.

    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.

    a. Attribution.
    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
    must:
    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
    Material:
    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
    designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
    Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
    ii. a copyright notice;
    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
    practicable;
    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
    of any previous modifications; and
    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
    include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
    manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
    Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
    conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the
    required information.
    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
    required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You
    apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying
    with this Public License.
    Section 4 Sui Generis Database Rights.

    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
    Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
    is Adapted Material; and
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
    Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
    other Copyright and Similar Rights.

    Section 5 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
    and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
    Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
    includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
    known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
    b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
    for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
    exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
    Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has
    been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.
    Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
    limitation may not apply to You.
    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
    Section 6 Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
    Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
    License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
    within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.

    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
    Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
    Public License.
    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
    Section 7 Other Terms and Conditions.

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
    and conditions of this Public License.
    Section 8 Interpretation.

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
    be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
    of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission
    under this Public License.
    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
    shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
    enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
    to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
    limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
    the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
    or authority.`
