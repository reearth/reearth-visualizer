Important Changes: ''
dashboard.assets.migration.warning: >-
  Based on functional requirements, we have decided to adjust the project
  structure. The asset management page, which was originally part of the
  workspace, will be moved to individual project pages. In other words, assets
  will now be managed under each project, making it more convenient for users to
  import and export them. <br/>As a result, the current page will no longer
  exist and will be removed in the next version. For more details, please refer
  to <1>this page</1>.
